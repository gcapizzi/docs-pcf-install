Configure **Logging of Client IPs in CF Router**. The **Log client IPs** option is set by default. To comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), select one of the following options to disable logging of client IP addresses:
  * If your load balancer exposes its own source IP address, disable logging of the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header only.
  * If your load balancer exposes the source IP of the originating client, disable logging of both the source IP address and the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.
