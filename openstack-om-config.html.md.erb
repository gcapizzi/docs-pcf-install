<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director after deploying
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack.
Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
topic.
After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Installing PAS after Deploying PCF on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html)
topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id='log-in'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For security, Ops Manager 1.7 and later require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager.</a></p>

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](./openstack-setup.html#dns-entry) step of [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html).

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='internal'></a>Use Internal Authentication ###

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("cf-login.png") %>

## <a id='openstack-config'></a>Step 2: Complete the OpenStack Config Page ##

1. In the left navigation of your OpenStack dashboard, click **Project > Compute > Access & Security**. Select the **API Access** tab.

1. Record the **Service Endpoint** for the **Identity** service.
You use this Service Endpoint as the Authentication URL for Ops Manager in a
later step.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/record-endpoint.png") %>

1. In the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-tile.png") %>

1. Select **OpenStack Config**.

1. Complete the **OpenStack Management Console Config** page with the following information:
    * **Authentication URL**: Enter the Service Endpoint for the Identity
      service that you recorded in a previous step.
    * **Keystone Version**: Choose a Keystone version. If you choose **v3**, you must enter a **Domain** to authenticate against. 
    * **Username**: Enter your OpenStack Horizon username.
    * **Password**: Enter your OpenStack Horizon password.
    * **Tenant**: Enter your OpenStack tenant name.
    * **Region**: Enter `RegionOne`, or another region if recommended by your
      OpenStack administrator.
    * **Select OpenStack omNetwork Type**: Select either **Nova**, the legacy OpenStack networking model,
    or **Neutron**, the newer networking model.
    * **Ignore Server Availability Zone**: Do not select the checkbox.
    * **Security Group Name**: Enter `opsmanager`. You created this Security
      Group when [Provisioning the OpenStack
      Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html#security).
    * **Key Pair Name**: Enter the name of the key pair that you created in the
      [Configure Security](./openstack-setup.html#security) step of the
      [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html) topic.
    * **SSH Private Key**: In a text editor, open the key pair file that you
      downloaded in the [Configure Security](./openstack-setup.html#security)
      step of the [Provisioning the OpenStack
      Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html) topic. Copy and paste the contents of the key pair file into the field.
    * (Optional) **API SSL Certificate**: If, in your OpenStack Dashboard, you have configured API SSL termination, enter your **API SSL Certificate**.
    * **Disable DHCP**: Do not select the checkbox unless your setup requires it.
    * **Select OpenStack Network Type**: Select either **Nova**, the legacy networking model,
    or **Neutron**, the OpenStack networking model.

1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. Therefore, if you continue to use PCF JMX Bridge for consuming them outside of the Firehose, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this, leave the <strong>JMX Provider IP Address</strong> field blank.

1. Select **Assign Availability Zones**.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/assign-az.png") %>

1. From the **Singleton Availability Zone** drop-down menu, select the availability zone that you created in a previous step. The BOSH Director installs in this Availability Zone.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select the **Network** that you created in a previous step. BOSH Director installs in this network.
1. Click **Save**.

1. Select **Resource Config**.
    <%= image_tag("openstack/om-resource-config.png") %>
1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager v1.11 and above require a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>
