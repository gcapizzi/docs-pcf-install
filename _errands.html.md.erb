Errands are scripts that Ops Manager runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product, such as a new version of Pivotal Application Service (PAS). There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_ run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product in uninstalled.

By default, Ops Manager always runs pre-delete errands, and only runs post-deploy errands when the product has changed since the last time Ops Manager installed something. In PAS, the Smoke Test Errand defaults to always run.

The PAS tile **Errands** pane lets you change these run rules. For each errand, you can select **On** to run it always, **Off** to never run it, or **When Changed** to run it only when the product has changed since the last install.

For more information about how Ops Manager manages errands, see the [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html) topic.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Several errands deploy apps that provide services for your deployment, such as Autoscaling and Notifications. Once one of these apps is running, selecting <strong>Off</strong> for the corresponding errand on a subsequent installation does not stop the app.</p>

* **Smoke Test Errand** verifies that your deployment can do the following:

    * Push, scale, and delete apps
    * Create and delete orgs and spaces

* **Usage Service Errand** deploys the Pivotal Usage Service application, which Apps Manager depends on.

* **Apps Manager Errand** deploys Apps Manager, a dashboard for managing apps, services, orgs, users, and spaces. Until you deploy Apps Manager, you must perform these functions through the cf CLI. After Apps Manager has been deployed, Pivotal recommends deselecting the checkbox for this errand on subsequent PAS deployments. For more information about Apps Manager, see the [Getting Started with the Apps Manager](../console/dev-console.html) topic.

* **Notifications Errand** deploys an API for sending email notifications to your PCF platform users.

    <p id='notifications' class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> 
        The Notifications app requires that you <a href='#smtp'>configure SMTP</a> with a username and password, even if you set the value of <strong>SMTP Authentication Mechanism</strong> to <code>none</code>.
    </p>
    
* **Notifications UI Errand** deploys a dashboard for users to manage notification subscriptions.

* **Autoscaling Errand** enables you to configure your apps to automatically scale in response to changes in their usage load. See the [Scaling an Application Using Autoscaler](../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html) topic for more information.

* **Autoscaling Registration Errand** makes the Autoscaling service available to your applications. Without this errand, you cannot bind the Autoscaling app to your apps.

* **NFS Broker Errand** enables you to use NFS Volume Services by installing the NFS Broker app in PAS. See the [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html) topic for more information.

* **Delete Pivotal Account Application** deletes Pivotal Account, a dashboard that allowed users to create and manage their accounts. Pivotal Account is no longer being used by PAS and has been replaced by UAA.
