(Optional) By default, Gorouter support for the PROXY protocol is disabled. To enable the PROXY protocol, select <strong>Enable support for PROXY protocol in CF Router</strong>. When enabled, client-side load balancers that terminate TLS but do not support HTTP can pass along information from the originating client. Enabling this option may impact Gorouter performance. 
For more information about enabling the PROXY protocol in Gorouter, see the _HTTP Header Forwarding_ sections in the [Securing Traffic in Cloud Foundry](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html) topic.
