This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director for VMware vSphere.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to vSphere](deploying-vm.html) topic.
After you complete this procedure, follow the configuration instructions for the runtime you choose to install.
For example, to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS), see the [Configuring PAS for vSphere](config-er-vmware.html) topic.

See [Installing Runtimes](runtimes.html) for more information about Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) runtimes.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a>Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.

1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director, enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can also use this field to configure [a load balancer in front of your BOSH Director](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/225420588).

1. <%= partial "exclude-recursors" %>

1. (Optional) To disable BOSH DNS, select the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox. For more information about the BOSH DNS service discovery mechanism, see [BOSH DNS Service Discovery for Application Containers](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-dns) in the PAS Release Notes.
  <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: Do not disable BOSH DNS without consulting Pivotal Support. If you opt out of the BOSH DNS feature, your PCF deployment cannot support <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#nsx">NSX-T networking</a>. For more information about disabling BOSH DNS, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015720428-Disabling-or-Opting-Out-of-BOSH-DNS-in-PCF">Disabling or Opting Out of BOSH DNS in PCF</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are deploying PKS, do not disable BOSH DNS. If PAS and PKS are running on the same instance of Ops Manager, you cannot use the opt-out feature of BOSH DNS for your PAS without breaking PKS. If you want to opt out of BOSH DNS in your PAS deployment, install the tile on a separate instance of Ops Manager.</p>

1. (Optional) To set a custom banner that users see when logging in to the Director using SSH, enter text in the **Custom SSH Banner** field.
  <%= image_tag("disable-bosh-dns.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page

An Ops Manager availability zone (AZ) corresponds to your vCenter clusters and resource pools.

Multiple AZs allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application.

At least three AZs are recommended for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones** to navigate to the pane.
    
    <%= image_tag("create-az.png", :alt => "The 'Create Availability Zones' pane shows a list of two availability zones: 'first-az' and 'second-az' with a button to the right to 'Add'. The 'first-az' is expanded and shows the fields 'Name' and 'IaaS Configuration'. Below that, still in the expanded 'first-az', a subhead called 'Clusters' lists a group of two fields, 'Cluster' and 'Resource Pool' with a button to the right to 'Add Cluster'.") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more AZs for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ.
    * Select a vCenter config name from the **IaaS Configuration** dropdown to associate your AZ with a vCenter. If you have only one vCenter config or if you are creating your first AZ, **IaaS Configuration** defaults to the first vCenter and is nonconfigurable.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an AZ.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * **(Optional)** Click **Add Cluster** to create another set of **Cluster** and **Resource Pool** fields. You can add multiple clusters. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For more information about using availability zones in vSphere, see the <a href="./understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> topic.</p>
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.
1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network. 
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
1. Click **Save**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco
      Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The BOSH Director installs in this Availability Zone. 
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your BOSH Director.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 7: Security Page

<%= partial "security-pane" %>

## <a id='syslog'></a>Step 8: Syslog Page

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged.
For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials.
If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, using TLS encryption is strongly recommended to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

<%= partial 'syslog_bosh' %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="custom-vm-extensions"></a> Step 10: (Optional) Add Custom VM Extensions

<%= partial "vm-extension-config"  %>

## <a id='complete-installation'></a>Step 11: Complete the BOSH Director Installation
