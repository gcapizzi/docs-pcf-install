To use an external S3-compatible filestore for PAS file storage, perform the following steps:

1. In the PAS tile, select **File Storage**.
1. Select the **External S3-Compatible Filestore** option and complete the following fields:
    * Enter the `https://` **URL Endpoint** for your region.
          <br />
          For example, in the **us-west-2** region, enter
          `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * If you use an AWS instance profile to manage role information for your filestore, select the **S3 AWS with Instance Profile** checkbox. For more information, see [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) in the AWS documentation.

    * Alternatively, enter the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** of the `pcf-user` you created when configuring AWS for PCF. If you select the **S3 AWS with Instance Profile** checkbox and also enter an **Access Key** and **Secret Key**, the instance profile will overrule the Access Key and Secret Key.
    * From the **S3 Signature Version** dropdown, select **V4 Signature**.  For more information about S4 signatures, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS documentation.
    * For **Region**, enter the region in which your S3 buckets are located. `us-west-2` is an example of an acceptable value for this field. 
    * Select **Server-side Encryption** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. This option is only available for AWS S3.
    * (Optional) If you selected **Server-side Encryption**, you can also specify a **KMS Key ID**. PAS uses the KMS key to encrypt files uploaded to the blobstore. If you do not provide a KMS Key ID, PAS uses the default AWS key. For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
    * Configure the following depending on whether your S3 buckets have versioning enabled:
      - **Versioned S3 buckets**: Enable **Use versioning for backup and restore** to archive each bucket to a version.
      - **Unversioned S3 buckets**: Enter a backup bucket name for each active bucket. The backup bucket name must be different from the name of the active bucket it backs up.

    * Enter the following values for the remaining fields:

            <td><code>pcf-packages-bucket</code></td>
