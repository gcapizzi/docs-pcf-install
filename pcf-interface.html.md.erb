The following list describes each labeled section of the Installation Dashboard:

- **A**--- Displays a list of products you have imported that are ready for installation.
	* Click the **Import a Product** link to add a new product to Ops Manager.
	* If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. If you are using the [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html), the latest version of an existing product appears automatically.
 	* Click **Delete All Unused Products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **C**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**.

- **D**---**Settings**: This menu option opens a page with several configuration panes. See the [Settings Page](#settings) section of this topic for details.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued products and updates that will install during the next deploy. Click on a product to expand its list of errands and change the errand run rules for the next deploy. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes button**: Click the button to apply pending changes, as listed, to your deployment. Click **Change Log** to view the logs of past installation updates.

- **G**---**Orange bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is required before deployment. Click on the product tile to complete its configuration. In addition, the **Apply Changes** button is low lit to indicate that changes cannot be applied without additional product configuration.

- **H**---**Stemcell Library**: Click the link to open the Stemcell Library. In the Stemcell Library you can import stemcells, stage stemcells, and review your stemcell version numbers. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **I**---**Changelog**: Click the link to see and search a log of your previous installations. 

- **J**---**Review Pending Changes BETA**: Click the button to go to the "Review Pending Changes" page, which organizes pending changes by tile. You are able to enable or disable each tile to selectively deploy individual tiles. For more information, see [Deploying Select Tiles with Ops Manager](selective-deploy.html).

- **K**---**API Docs**: Click the link to go to the Ops Manager API documentation, which details how you can manage Ops Manager through the API rather than with the user interface. For more information about the Ops Manager API, see [Using the Ops Manager API](ops-man-api.html).

## <a id='settings'></a>Settings Page ##

Navigate to the **Settings** page by clicking on your user name located at the upper right corner of the screen and selecting **Settings**. 

<%= image_tag("settings_menu.png", :width => "500", :alt => "The 'Settings' page is indicated by a header that says 'Settings' in large type at the top of the page. Below the header, on the left-hand side, there is a tabular layout. From top to bottom, the tabs are 'Decryption Passphrase,' 'Authentication Method', 'SSL Certificate', 'External API Access', 'Proxy Settings', 'Custom Banner,' 'Export Installation Settings,' Syslog', and 'Advanced'. The top tab, 'Decryption Passphrase' is highlighted in gray to indicate selection. To the right, the body shows fields that correspond to 'Decryption Passphrase.'") %>

The following list describes each configuration pane:

- **Decryption Passphrase**: Reset your **decryption passphrase**.

- **Authentication Method**: You can switch Identity Providers by entering your **Decryption passphrase**, **Saml idp metadata**, and optionally, your **BOSH IdP metadata**. For more information about setting up your Identity Provider, view the following instructions for your configuration:
	* [Amazon Web Services](../customizing/pcf-aws-manual-om-config.html)
	* [Google Cloud Platform](../customizing/gcp-om-config.html#idp)
	* [Microsoft Azure](../customizing/azure-om-config.html#idp)
	* [OpenStack](../customizing/openstack-om-config.html#idp)
	* [vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html)

- **SSL Certificate:** Configure Ops Manager to use a custom SSL certificate for all Ops Manager traffic both through the UI and API. If you leave the fields blank, Ops Manager uses an auto-generated self-signed certificate rather than your own custom certificate and private key.
  
    <%= image_tag("settings-ssl-cert.png", :alt => "The 'Settings' page shows the 'SSL Certificate' pane highlighted on the left-hand tabular layout to indicate selection. The body shows a header titled 'SSL Certificate' with help text beneath and two required fields: 'Certificate' and 'Private key'. The 'Save' button is at the bottom of the body.") %>

- **External API Access**: Enter your [Pivotal Network API](../customizing/add-delete.html#pivnet-api) token to connect your **Installation Dashboard** to the Pivotal Network.

- **Proxy Settings**: If you are using a proxy to connect to Ops Manager, update your **Proxy Settings** by providing a **HTTP proxy**, **HTTPS proxy**, or **No proxy**.

- **Custom Banner**: Create a custom text banner to communicate important messages to operators. For **UI Banner**, enter the text you want to be shown on each page of the Ops Manager UI. For **SSH Banner**, enter the text that appears when an operator shells into Operations Manager.

	<%= image_tag("banner-ui.png", :alt => "A teal banner sits at the top of the 'Settings' page that says 'Attention: By entering text into the UI Banner field, your message appears on every page of Ops Manager.' Below, the Settings page shows the 'Custom Banner' pane highlighted in the tabulated menu to indicate selection. In the body, from top to bottom, you find the 'Update Custom Banner' header with optional text fields 'UI Bannner' and 'SSH Banner' beneath. The UI Banner field shows the exact text shown in the teal banner. A 'Save' button is at the bottom of the body.") %>

- **Export Installation Settings**: Exports the current installation with all of its assets. When you export an installation, the exported file contains references to the installation IP addresses. It also contains the base VM images and necessary packages. As a result, an export can be very large, 5 GB or more in size.

- **Syslog**: Configure a custom Syslog server for Ops Manager. When you select **Yes** and fill the following fields, Ops Manager produces and sends all Ops Manager logs to the configured syslog endpoint.
  * **Address** - Enter the address or host of the syslog server.
  * **Port** - Enter the port on which the syslog server listens.
  * **Transport Protocol** - Select either `TCP`, `UDP`, or `RELP` to specify a transport protocol used to send syslog messages to your server.
  * **Enable TLS** (Optional) - Enable to send secure logs with TLS encryption. Once you **Enable TLS**, you must enter your **Permitted Peer** and **SSL Certificate**. Your **Permitted Peer** is either the accepted fingerprint such as a SHA1 or the name of the remote peer. For example, `*.example.com`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager does not issue a warning if your credentials are invalid. Instead, Ops Manager continues as if your credentials are correct. Test your syslog server to ensure that it is receiving Ops Manager logs.</p>

	<%= image_tag("syslog-settings.png", :alt => "The Syslog pane is selected in the 'Settings' page. In the body, the header says 'Syslog' with help text below and a series of Syslog-related fields and a 'Save' button.") %>

- **Advanced**:
  	* **Download activity data** - Downloads a directory containing the config file for the installation, the deployment history, and version information.
	* **Download Root CA Cert** - Use this to download the root CA certificate of your deployment as an alternative to curling the Ops Manager API.
	* **View diagnostic report** - Displays various types of information about the configuration of your deployment.
	* **Delete this Installation**

## <a id='account_settings'></a>My Account Page ##

To change your email and password, navigate to the **My Account** page by clicking on your user name located at the upper right corner of the screen and selecting **My Account**. 

<%= image_tag("account_settings.png", :alt=> "This example 'Account Settings' page shows two subheadings titled 'Profile' and 'Third Party Access'. Under 'Profile' is an email 'admin@test.org' and an obscured password using asterisks. The email and password have two corresponding links to the right: 'Change Email' and 'Change Password'. Under 'Third Party Access' is a paragraph that says 'You have not yet authorized any third party applications.'" ) %>
