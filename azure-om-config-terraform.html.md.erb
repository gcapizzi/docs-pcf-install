<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure after [Launching a BOSH Director Instance on Azure using Terraform](./azure-deploy-terraform.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in
this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the
<a href="ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisite ##

To complete the procedures in this topic, you must have access to the output
from when you ran `terraform apply` to create resources for this deployment.
You can view this output at any time by running `terraform output`.
You use the values in your Terraform output to configure the BOSH Director tile.

## <a id='access-om'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For security, Ops Manager v1.7 and later require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name.</a></p> 

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the BOSH Director.
Use the `ops_manager_dns` value from running `terraform output`.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider (IdP) ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.
